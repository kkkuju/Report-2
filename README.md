1. RGB color selector
2. PB value displayed on serial monitor and blink (without using Delay)
3. Connect potentiometer and display bit-value and voltage value on serial monitor
4. Potentiometer change RGB color from black to white through different color
variations
5. Connect LCD and Display bitvalue and voltage on the same screen
6. LCD show bitvalue when PB is not pressed and Voltage when it is pressed
7. LCD with Arduino to work as ohmmeter with display the â„¦ symbol.
